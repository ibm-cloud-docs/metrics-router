# About routes
{: #routes}

You can manage routes in your account by using the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} UI, the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} CLI, the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} REST API, and the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} Terraform provider. A route defines the rules that indicate what metrics are routed in a region and where to route them.
{: shortdesc}


## Understanding how routes work in your account
{: #route_behaviour}

Note the following information about routes:

* Routes are global under an account and are evaluated in all regions where {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full}} is deployed.

* You can define a route from any of the supported locations where {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} is available. For more information, see [Locations](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-regions).

* Routes may be accessed from any regional {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} API endpoint.

* You can define up to 30 routes for an account.

* By default, the account has 0 routes configured.

* You can configure up to 10 rules for each route.

* You can configure up to 8 locations for each rule.

* You can configure up to 3 targets (`{"targets":[{"id":ID1},{"id":ID2},{"id":ID3}]`) for each rule.

* Routes are processed independently.  If you have multiple routes with rules that match the same metric data, that data will be sent to multiple targets.

* Rules in 1 route definition are processed in order. The first matching rule (for example, `location`) that matches metrics data is used to process that data.  When metrics are processed, they will not be processed by a subsequent rule within that route's definition. If you want to specify a default rule for all metrics that are not processed by other rules, you would specify the rule (`"locations" : ["*"]`) as the final rule in your `rules` definition for the `route`.

* If metrics data doesn't match any rule and no default target is configured, the metrics are dropped and not routed to any target.

* Any update to 1 or more rules in a route definition discards the existing rule set and replaces it with the specified configuration. When you update a route, you must define all existing rules in the rule set that do not change and add the changes to the rules that must be updated.

* Information about routes is stored as metadata in the primary location that you have set for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

    If you do not configure a primary metadata location, the location is set to the location where you define your first target in the account. For more information, see [Configuring account settings](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-settings).

* You can use private and public endpoints to manage routes. For more information about the list of `ENDPOINTS` that are available, see [Endpoints](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-endpoints).

    * You can manage routes from the private network by using an API endpoint with the following format: `https://private.REGION.metrics-router.cloud.ibm.com`

    * You can manage routes from the public network by using an API endpoint with the following format: `https://REGION.metrics-router.cloud.ibm.com`

    * You can disable the public endpoints by updating the account settings. For more information, see [Enforcing private endpoints](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-endpoints-enforce-private).

* The route name must be 1000 characters or less and cannot include any special characters other than space, dash `-`, dot `.`, underscore `_`, and colon `:`.

    The name must not include any personal identifying information (PII).
    {: important}

After you configure a route, it might take up to 1 hour for the configuration to be enabled.

When you use the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} REST API, you can get standard HTTP response codes to indicate whether a method completed successfully.

- A 200 response always indicates success.
- A 4xx response indicates a failure.
- A 5xx response usually indicates an internal system error.

See the following table for some HTTP response codes:

| Status code | Status | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `200` |	OK | The request was successful. |
| `201` |	OK | The request was successful. A resource is created. |
| `204` |	OK | The route was successfully deleted. |
| `400` | Bad Request |	The request was unsuccessful. You might be missing a parameter that is required. |
| `401` |	Unauthorized | The IAM token that is used in the API request is invalid or expired. |
| `403` |	Forbidden | The operation is forbidden due to insufficient permissions. |
| `404` | Not Found |	The requested resource doesn't exist or is already deleted. |
| `429` |	Too Many Requests |	Too many requests reach the API too quickly. |
| `500` |	Internal Server Error |	Something went wrong in {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} processing. |
