# Routing all metrics
{: #route-rule-all-metrics}

Route all metrics that are generated in all of the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full}} supported locations to multiple destination targets.
{: shortdesc}

A rule consists of 1 or more targets, and 1 or more inclusion filters. For more information on how routes work, see [Understanding how routes work in your account](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-routes&interface=cli#route_behaviour).

Inclusion filters determine which metrics are routed to the targets.

To route all metrics, you must exclude the `inclusion_filters` definition when you configure the route.
