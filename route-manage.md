# Managing routes
{: #route-manage}

You can manage routes in your account by using the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} UI, the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} CLI, the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} REST API, and the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} Terraform provider. A route defines the rules that indicate what metrics are routed in a region and where to route them.
{: shortdesc}

For more information on {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} routes, see [routes](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-routes&interface=cli).



## About routes
{: #route-manage-about}

You can configure {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} to route platform metrics that are generated in different regions where the service is supported to a target destination.

-  You can only route platform metrics that are generated in regions where {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} is available. For more information, see [Regions](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-regions).

- If you have regulatory and compliance requirements, check the route rules comply with them.



## IAM Access
{: #route-manage-iam}

You must have the correct IAM permissions to manage routes. For information, see [Managing IAM access.](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-iam)



## Creating a route using the UI
{: #route-create-ui}
{: ui}

Do the following to create a route using the UI.

1. [Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.

2. Click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) &gt; **Observability**.

3. Click **Monitoring**.

4. Click **Routing**.

5. Click the **Routes** tab.

6. Click **Create** to open the create a route page.

7. Enter a meaningful name for the route.

8. Click **Next**.

9. In **Routing rules**, modify the **Action** for **Rule 1**:

    - Select `Send` for the rule to route metrics to the associated targets.

    - Select `Drop` for the rule to drop metrics matching this rule.

10. Add the [inclusion filters](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-route_rules_definitions&interface=ui#route_rules_definitions_filters) to determine the metrics routed to the targets specified in the rule.

   Select the desired filter and condition and specify the value to be matched by the inclusion filter.

   To add multiple inclusion filters, click **Add filter** to add additional filters.

11. Add the [target](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-target&interface=ui) to associate with the rule by selecting a target from the list. If you do not have a target defined, click **Add target** to create a new target.

12. Click **Add rule** to add additional rules to the route.

    The order of route rules affects the routing behavior. Rules are processed in order and once a rule is matched, the subsequent rules are not processed.

    The order of the routing rules can be changed by clicking the up and down arrows to the right of each rule definition.

    If you need to remove a rule or filter, click the **Remove** icon associated with the rule or filter.

    You can configure up to 10 rules per route.

```shell
curl -X GET <ENDPOINT>/api/v3/routes -H "Authorization: $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "content-type: application/json"
```
{: codeblock}

Where

- `<ENDPOINT>` is the API endpoint in the region where you plan to configure or manage a route. For more information, see [Endpoints](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-endpoints).

## HTTP response codes
{: #route-manage-api-rc}
{: api}

When you use the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} REST API, you can get standard HTTP response codes to indicate whether a method completed successfully.

- A 200 response always indicates success.
- A 4xx response indicates a failure.
- A 5xx response indicates an internal system error.

See the following table for some HTTP response codes:

| Status code | Status | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `200` |	OK | The request was successful. |
| `201` |	OK | The request was successful. A resource is created. |
| `400` | Bad Request |	The request was unsuccessful. You might be missing a parameter that is required. |
| `401` |	Unauthorized | The IAM token that is used in the API request is invalid or expired. |
| `403` |	Forbidden | The operation is forbidden due to insufficient permissions. |
| `404` | Not Found |	The requested resource doesn't exist or is already deleted. |
| `429` |	Too Many Requests |	Too many requests hit the API too quickly. |
| `500` |	Internal Server Error |	Something went wrong in {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} processing. |
