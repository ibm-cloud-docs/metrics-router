# Managing {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} targets
{: #target-manage}

You can manage {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} targets in your account by using the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} CLI, the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} REST API, and the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} Terraform provider. A target is a resource where you can collect metrics.
{: shortdesc}

For more information on {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} targets, see [Targets](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-target).



## About {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} targets
{: #target-manage-about}

You can configure {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} to route metrics that are generated in different regions where the service is supported to a {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} target.

-  You can only route metrics that are generated in regions where {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} is available. For more information, see [Regions](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-regions).

- If you have regulatory and compliance requirements, check the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} target is available in a valid location.

- To configure {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} to route metrics to a {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} instance, you must configure a service to service authorization. You do not have to provide credentials to {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}}. You can define a service to service authorization between the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} service and an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} service in the same account, or between the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} service and an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} service in a different account.

    For information on configuring Service to Service authentiation, see [Managing authorizations to grant access between services](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-iam-service-auth).


## IAM Access
{: #target-manage-iam}

You must have the correct IAM permissions to manage targets. For information, see [Managing IAM access.](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-iam)


## CLI prerequisites
{: #target-manage-cli-prereqs}
{: cli}

Before you use the CLI to manage targets, complete the following steps:

1. [Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli).

2. [Install the {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} CLI](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-metrics-router-cli-config).

3. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Run the following command: [ibmcloud login](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_login)

4. Before you configure {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} routes or targets, you must configure a primary metadata region. The primary metadata region is configured using the [`ibmcloud metrics-router setting update` command `--primary-metadata-region` option.](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-metrics-router-cli#settings-update-cli)
